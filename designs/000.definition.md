# Base Definitions

Common types and structures for civilization game design.

## ID Types

UUID-based unique identifiers for various entities.

## Processes

The unified system combines production and consumption processes, linking resource transformation with cluster needs.

```
ProcessType {
    name: string
    description: string
    inputResources: []ResourceChange
    outputResources: []ResourceChange
    processTime: int            // Days to complete
}

ResourceChange {
    resourceType: ResourceTypeID
    unitID: UnitID?
    plotID: PlotID?
    size: float
}
```

## Resource

```
ResourceType {
    resourceTypeID: ResourceTypeID
    name: string
    description: string
    resourceEfficiencys: []ResourceEfficiency
}
```

```
ResourceEfficiencyType {
    resourceEfficiencyTypeID: ResourceEfficiencyTypeID
    name: string // e.g., "Food", "Tool", "Construction", "Energy", "Luxury"
    description: string
}
```

```
ResourceEfficiency {
    resourceEfficiencyTypeID: ResourceEfficiencyTypeID
    rate: float
}
```

## Unit

Units are generalized entities that can represent various types of active entities including buildings, caravans, missions, armies, etc. Units are categorized into building units (stationary) and movable units.

### Unit Categories

**Building Units** are stationary structures that provide production, storage, and shelter:
- Cave: Natural shelter providing protection
- Bonfire: Basic gathering point for warmth and cooking
- Farm ground: Agricultural production area
- Ranch ground: Animal husbandry area
- Fishing ground: Fishing and aquaculture area
- Picking ground: Foraging and gathering area

**Movable Units** are mobile groups that can traverse the map:
- Hunting team: Resource gathering from wildlife
- Trade team: Commerce and resource exchange
- Warriors team: Combat and defense

```
UnitType {
    unitTypeID: UnitTypeID
    name: string
    description: string
    category: UnitCategory
    processes: []ProcessType
    storages: []StorageType
    workerRequirement: []WorkerRequirement
    terrainCompatibility: []TerrainTypeID
}

UnitCategory enum {
    BUILDING
    MOVABLE
}
```

```
WorkerRequirement {
    clusterIDs: []ClusterID
    skills: []Skill
    size: int
}
```

```
Unit {
    unitID: UnitID
    unitTypeID: UnitTypeID
    ownerClusterID: ClusterID?
    workerClusterIDs: []ClusterID
}
```

## PlotAttributes

```
PlotAttributes {
    ownerClusterID: ClusterID?
    terrainType: TerrainTypeID
    neighborPlots: []PlotID
    storages: []StorageType
    units: []Unit
    clusters: []Cluster
}
```

```
TerrainType {
    terrainTypeID: TerrainTypeID
    name: string
    description: string
    processes: []ProcessType
}
```

## StorageType

```
StorageType {
    size: float
    capacity: float
    resourceType: ResourceTypeID
}
```

## Skill

```
SkillType {
    skillTypeID: SkillTypeID
    name: string
    description: string
}
```

```
Skill {
    skillTypeID: SkillTypeID
    experience: float
}
```

## Clusters

Clusters represent groups that entities can belong to, including religions, cultures, and potentially clans, families, nations, and alliances in the future. Clusters are categorized into enlightened (sentient beings) and animal clusters.

### Cluster Categories

**Enlightened Clusters** represent sentient species capable of civilization building:
- Human: Versatile species adaptable to various environments
- Elf: Nature-aligned species with affinity for forests
- Orc: Hardy species suited for harsh environments

**Animal Clusters** represent groups of animals that can be domesticated or hunted:
- Horse: Fast mount for transportation and warfare
- Cattle: Livestock for food, leather, and labor
- Chicken: Poultry for food and eggs
- Goat: Hardy livestock for food and milk
- Sheep: Livestock for wool and food

```
ClusterType {
    clusterTypeID: ClusterTypeID
    name: string
    description: string
    category: ClusterCategory
    terrainPreference: []TerrainTypeID
    domesticatable: bool  // For animal clusters
}

ClusterCategory enum {
    ENLIGHTENED
    ANIMAL
}

Cluster {
    clusterID: ClusterID
    clusterType: ClusterTypeID
    name: string
    description: string
    skills: []Skill
    size: int
    relationships: []ClusterRelationship
}

ClusterRelationship {
    targetCluster: ClusterID
    favorability: float  // -1.0 (hostile) to 1.0 (friendly)
}
```
