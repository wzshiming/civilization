# Base Definitions

This document defines common types and structures used across all design documents.

## Basic Types

```
PlayerID: unique identifier for a player
PlotID: unique identifier for a plot
BuildingID: unique identifier for a building
PopulationID: unique identifier for a population group
CultureID: unique identifier for a culture
ReligionID: unique identifier for a religion
ResourceType: type of resource (IRON, HORSES, OIL, WHEAT, FOOD, etc.)
SpeciesType: type of species (HUMAN, ELF, DWARF, etc.)
TerrainType: type of terrain (OCEAN, COAST, GRASSLAND, PLAINS, DESERT, TUNDRA, FOREST, JUNGLE, MOUNTAIN, HILL, SWAMP, ICE)
BuildingType: type of building (FARM, MINE, FACTORY, TEMPLE, etc.)
GrowthFactorType: factors affecting population growth (FOOD, TEMPERATURE, HAPPINESS, OVERCROWDING, etc.)
```

## Coordinate System

All coordinates use abstract world units. Map dimensions define the coordinate space (e.g., width=1000 means x ranges from 0 to 1000).

```
Point {
    x: float  // World coordinates
    y: float
}
```

## Calendar System

```
daysPerMonth: int = 30  // Configurable game calendar constant
```

## Religion System

```
Religion {
    id: ReligionID
    name: string
    relationships: []ReligionRelationship  // Relations with other religions
}

ReligionRelationship {
    targetReligion: ReligionID
    favorability: float         // Relationship level (-1.0 to 1.0, negative = hostile)
    tolerance: float            // Tolerance level (0.0 to 1.0)
}
```

## Culture System

```
Culture {
    id: CultureID
    name: string
    relationships: []CultureRelationship  // Relations with other cultures
}

CultureRelationship {
    targetCulture: CultureID
    favorability: float         // Relationship level (-1.0 to 1.0)
    affinity: float             // Cultural affinity (0.0 to 1.0)
}
```

## Notes

- IDs are typically integers or UUIDs depending on implementation
- Float values are typically 32-bit or 64-bit floating point numbers
- Arrays are denoted with [] prefix
- Optional/nullable types are denoted with ? suffix
- Favorability ranges: -1.0 (hostile) to 1.0 (friendly)
- Percentage ranges: 0.0 to 1.0 (representing 0% to 100%)
