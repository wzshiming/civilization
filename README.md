# Civilization

This is an experimental game project of vibe coding

It aims to integrate several of my favorite strategy simulation games

- [Crusader Kings Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_III)
- [Victoria Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_3)
- [Stellaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(video_game))
- [Civilization Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V)

This will be a web-based multiplayer strategy simulation game.

You will play as a person (and their heirs), evolving from early human civilization to the space age.
