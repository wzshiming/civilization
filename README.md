# Civilization - Stone Age Strategy Game

A minimalist web-based overhead historical strategy game prototype where you manage and evolve a Stone Age tribe on a static map. Inspired by Paradox Development Studio games.

## Features

### Map System
- **GeoJSON-based map** with 11 provinces (7 land, 4 water regions)
- **Interactive provinces** with hover highlighting
- **Minimalist design** featuring light beige land and light blue water
- Click provinces to view detailed information in the console

### Tribal Management
- Tribe spawns on a random land province at game start
- **Three core resources:** Population, Food, and Flint
- Real-time resource display in the side panel
- Visual tribe marker on the map

### Exploration & Expansion
- Click neighboring provinces to explore and expand your territory
- **Exploration cost:** 10 food + 5 population
- Controlled provinces are visually distinct (darker green)
- Strategic gameplay: manage resources to expand your civilization

### Resource Generation
- **Automatic food generation** every 5 seconds
- Each controlled province generates +2 food per cycle
- Resource income scales with territory size

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe game logic
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Rendering engine
- **Vite** - Modern build tool for fast development
- **GeoJSON** - Map data format

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wzshiming/civilization.git
cd civilization

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game** - A tribe will spawn on a random land province with initial resources
2. **Explore neighboring provinces** - Click on adjacent land provinces to expand
3. **Manage resources** - Each exploration costs 10 food and 5 population
4. **Grow your civilization** - Controlled provinces automatically generate food every 5 seconds
5. **Expand strategically** - Balance exploration with resource management

## Game Mechanics

### Resources
- **Population:** Used for exploration and represents your tribe's size
- **Food:** Consumed during exploration, generated by controlled provinces
- **Flint:** Currently tracked (ready for future features like tools/weapons)

### Territory Control
- Provinces turn darker green when controlled
- Only neighboring land provinces can be explored
- Water provinces cannot be controlled

### Resource Generation
- Timer: Every 5 seconds
- Rate: +2 food per controlled province
- Example: 3 controlled provinces = +6 food every 5 seconds

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for expansion:
- Multiple tribes/factions with AI
- Flint resource usage (tools, weapons)
- Province-specific bonuses (forests, hills, rivers)
- Population growth mechanics
- Combat system for contested territories
- Technology/advancement tree
- Save/load game state
